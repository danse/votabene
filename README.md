# Votabene

A visualization of some Italian indexes during the last governments, available
at its heroku domain <http://votabene.herokuapp.com>.

More details, in Italian, on the github pages for this project:
<http://danse.github.com/votabene/>.

# The concept

The purpose of the visualization is to highlight the monotone negative trends
about Italy in the latest years, in order to better spot what should be changed
in the future. Many Italians like me have the evident feeling of things going
worse in the last years, and this is an effort to be more pragmatic about the
reasons of the problems we all lived.

# Main files

There is a big mess in the repo due to the dependencies brutally copied in, but the relevant files are just two:

    script.coffee
    index.html

And this one for the tests:

    spec/script.js

Oh, and obviously, the `data` folder, and the `make-info.coffee` in order to
prepare the data!
