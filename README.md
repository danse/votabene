# Votabene

A visualization of some Italian indexes during the last governments, available
at [its nodester domain](http://votabene.nodester.com).

Still a work in progress.

# Main files

There is a big mess in the repo due to the dependencies brutally copied in, but the relevant files are just two:

    script.coffee
    index.html

And this one for the tests:

    spec/script.js
